# React Fundamentals

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of React exercises and small projects created while learning modern React development.

The focus is on understanding core concepts and best practices rather than producing a single polished application.

## Learning Approach
I am learning React through structured coursework and hands-on practice, with an emphasis on:
- Writing readable, maintainable components
- Understanding state, props, and component lifecycles
- Using hooks effectively
- Thinking in terms of component-driven UI design

## Topics Covered
- Functional components
- JSX
- State and props
- `useState`, `useEffect`
- Event handling
- Conditional rendering
- Basic project structure

## Course Reference
Material is based on **The Ultimate React Course** by Jonas Schmedtmann, supplemented with additional experimentation and refactoring.

## Notes
This repository is intentionally iterative. Some projects are partial or evolving as concepts are introduced and revisited.
